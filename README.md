## Demonstration of unit testing in Unity 4

Basic implementation of a [singly-linked list](Assets/Lib/SinglyLinkedList.cs "SinglyLinkedList"), providing a method to get the 5th element from the end.  

Uses [SharpUnit](https://github.com/mgants4/SharpUnit "SharpUnit") by Mark Gants to run a [set of unit tests against the GetNthLast method](Assets/Tests/ListTest.cs "unit tests").

### Files for review

The class for the singly-linked list can be found [here](Assets/Lib/SinglyLinkedList.cs "SinglyLinkedList").

Tests against GetNthLast method can be found [here](Assets/Tests/ListTest.cs "unit tests").

### How to test

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in Unity 4.
2. Open and Play the ListTest scene.
3. Check the Console for test results.

I'd like to see the results visualised in the scene itself, just for fun:  coming soon!
